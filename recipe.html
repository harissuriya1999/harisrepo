    <h1>Gelato:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Gelato is a highly popular Italian ice cream thatâ€™s made with whole milk, rather than cream. As a result, <br>gelato has a lower milk fat percentage than American ice cream.</li>
<li>Gelato is also made without eggs and stabilizers and churned at a lower speed which creates a thick and dense <br>texture. The most popular gelato flavors are pistachio, vanilla, strawberry, and stracciatella.</li>
